Write a function that converts KG into st and lbs.
This will be rounded to the nearest lb.
e.g. 80KG => "12st, 8lb".
The output must be formatted as follows: "8st, 6lb".
You will need to validate that the input is a positive integer.
If it isn't return the string "Make sure your number is a positive integer".
